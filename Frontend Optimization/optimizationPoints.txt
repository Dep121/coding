Optimize LCP(Largest Contentful Paint), FID(First Input Delay), CLS(Cumulative Layout Shift)

LCP
1. Use Webp or avif for image
    use bare minimum fonts to render the page
2. Use a CDN
3. Rendering Blocking JS --> delay LCP --> to avoid it use SSR using NextJS
4. Optimize loading of resources on priority --> use "preload" tag and use fetchpriority="low" or fetchpriority="high"
    for image tags
5. less than 2.5ms is good and more than 4s is bad

FID
1. less than 100ms is good and more than 300ms is bad
2. FID --> user is able to click on button and event handlers are triggering
3. To optimize it reduce the javascript execution time --> use web workers or use lazy loading

CLS
1. use image width and height or use the CSS aspect-ratio property
2. less than 0.1 is good and more than 0.25 is bad

use web vitals chrome extension by google for a single page
and use unlighthouse to measure all the pages of websites. it does in parallel for all the pages so it takes some minutes.
You can use unlighthouse sdk in CI/CD pipeline also.
